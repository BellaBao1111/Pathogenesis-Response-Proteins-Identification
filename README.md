# Pathogenesis Response Proteins Identification (Python)
## UC San Diego – Biological Science
### Jan 2022 – Mar 2022

- Compared structural similarity in pathogenesis response proteins between apples (Mal d 2) and cherry (Pru av 2) to identify common potential allergen
- Performed pairwise sequencing alignment (Pairwise2), 3D protein alignment (Pymol), 3D protein measurement (RCSB PDB) in mRNA sequence of Mal d 2 and Pru av 2 from NCBI database
- Visualized pairwise alignment scores (heatmap)
